once upon a time there were three friends. One of them was a God and the other two were humans. The God didnt know how to treat his friends and the friends were fearful  of the God. then blah blah blah they all died .the end
Just Kidding, They didn't die. The God taught the humans to recognize that they were also Gods. He showed them how to be men of valor and how to respect women.
